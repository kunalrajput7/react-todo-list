# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### 1) In this project Material-UI is used. To install run:
```python
npm install @material-ui/core
```
##### 2) Material-UI was developed based on the Roboto font. The Roboto font will not be automatically loaded into Material-UI. To install it:
```python
npm install fontsource-roboto
```

##### 3) Then import it in "index.js". To do so write in "index.js":`
```python
import 'fontsource-roboto';
```

##### 4) To use icons run:
```python
npm install @material-ui/icons
```
##### 5) You can run the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
```python
npm start
```
The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

##### 6) Or else you can build the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
```python
npm run build
```
### Your app is ready to be deployed!
